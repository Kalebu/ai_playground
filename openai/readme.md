# OpenAI

set your openai key using something like

```bash
export OPENAIKEY=‘sk-hlFhgRu8ej8StctH............3pj0Qi5PSv20llsun’

```

> the client I am using is old version, need to use new style


## own language

see own_language_3script.py

is so easy to use openai to create an own language and use an LLM to get to it

3script is the eaiest language ever, made to be human readable and very forgiving
