I want to design a programming language called V based on golang.

There are some differences.
The properties in a struct are always snake case and lowercase
A struct always start with keyword 'struct'
'pub mut: ' is used to define that its public and mutable
Default values in a stuct are defined with '=' and should only be used when specified.

The same as golang, if a property name of json is not the same as the struct property name json:... is used for each line in struct to mark difference, this is onlyb done for properties where name is different.
         
An example struct is written as follows

pub struct MyStruct {
pub mut:
	myid    string = "11"
	mytext  string
	mytime  Time
}

An enumerator uses as keywoard enum and has pub in front to be public. For an emumerator we don't use 'pub mut:' inside

An example Enumerator is written as follows

pub enum Color{
    red = 1
    green = 3
    blue = 4
}

A struct property which has name _enum inside is an enumerator and needs to be treated as such. Change the enum property name to no longer have _enum inside.

When calling a constructor we use a params struct which is written as follows.


[params]
pub struct ConstructorArgs{
pub:
	name string
	id u32
	description string
	generate bool
	privatekey string //given in hex or mnemonics
}

an example constructor is

pub fn new(args_ ConstructorArgs) !MyStruct {
	mut args:=args_
    //here all initialiation happens
    //will return a Struct
}

a struct will be returned

The language knows has a standard way how to talk to a sql database.
SQL is in ANSI Standard.
