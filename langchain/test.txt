THREEFOLD ARCHITECTURE
March 2023

PURPOSE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY
Imagine a world where we can deliver a new sovereign internet system for
less than 1 USD per month per person while consuming less than 1 watt of electricity.
The following components complement the existing web3 ecosystem:
●
●

●

3Node
3Bot
Vlang

any computer running our bare metal operating system and quantum safe storage system
your personal assistant and gateway to the web2&3 world
language as used inside the 3bot, easier than Golang, more efﬁcient, 25k github stars

Our community has developed many applications required to deliver a true possible
alternative to our current centralized internet with alternatives to WhatsApp, Zoom,
Google Docs, YouTube ... We are working with some country governments to make this
vision a reality.

THIS IS THE INTERNET’S NATURAL PROGRESSION
The Internet was always meant to be a peer-to-peer infrastructure.
As large companies became proﬁt and data centric, centralization quickly became the norm..

Education: Too influenced by IT vendors, too many abstraction layers
Large IT companies: Acquisition strategy forces them to integrate = complex layers
IT startups: Painkiller approach pays off
It’s easier to build layers on top of other layers instead of rewriting

Our efﬁcient, green and

Our Zero-OS software powers our
decentralization movement. It allows
anyone to provide Internet capacity for
everyone, everywhere. This allows for a
self healing and self driving ultra reliable
internet infrastructure, owned by all of
us.

QUANTUM SAFE STORAGE
PLUGS INTO ANY INTERFACE
QS File System plugs into anything that needs
storage capacity e.g. IPFS, 3Bot, S3, FTP, HTTP, …
Plans to integrate better in Web3 ecosystem.

PEER-2-PEER
No centralized services in the middle, every person
Through his/her 3Bot has full control over where the data
is. The data is 100% private per person.

ALWAYS CONSISTENT, AUTO RECOVERY
Storage layer detects data corruption and recover
automatically. Data is stored on top of 3Nodes using an
advanced dispersal mechanism (not replication).

QUANTUM SAFE
Not even a quantum computer can hack the data.
There are no fragments on a shared medium like a
blockchain. All is fully dispersed in such a way that
data can never be lost nor corrupted.

○
With Many Interfaces
○
At start: Ethereum, Stellar, ThreeFold, Nostr, IPFS, BTC, BTC Lightening
Atomic Swap Support: for Stellar, TFT, BTC, Ethereum based Chains
3x faster development efﬁciency should be possible.

○
Easy to read & learn (few ways how to do something)
○
JSON-RPC (usable from all languages) and VLANG (for embedded development)
Ultimate Scale
○
We want to be able to grow to hundreds of millions of users, a true scaleout system is needed.
○
Our smart contract for IT allows deployment of any web 2,3 and 3BOT workload everywhere.
Ultimate Sovereignity
○
Governments want all data in country, they want their independence.
Possible Antidote for the Cyber Pandemic
○
3BOT + WEB3 + 3NODES is a good architecture with better security build in.
○
Add on: browser virtualization technology from 3BOT (run no javascript in existing browsers)
No Painkiller Approach (resolve the root of the problem)
○
Today they have too many systems and it's too complex, expansive and not secure.

ZERO-OS: A LIGHTWEIGHT STATELESS SECURE OPERATING SYSTEM
Core-0
First process launched on the Zero-OS.
This process kicks off all activities on the
node and allows the full OS to be booted
over the network maintaining full
integrity and hacking surfaces.

Hardware Node
All nodes are based on Intel, AMD or
ARM* based CPU’s. The peripheral
hardware requires an amount of CPU
cores, GB’s of memory and physical
storage devices, ideally a mix of SSD and
HDD storage.

CORE-0

Compute Primitives
Storage Primitives
Network Primitives

Kernel
Zero-OS uses the well known Linux
kernel because it has device drivers for
almost any hardware that exists (Intel /
AMD processor types. TFTech
customized the kernel: make it smaller
and added secure boot elements.

FLISTS = represents a very efﬁcient way to

Contains only metadata, not the full blob.
Downloading dramatically improves bandwidth
usage and download time.
Stored and made available on the ﬂy in the “hub”,
i.e. http server serving static ﬁles.

LOWER AMOUNT OF CONTEXT SWITCHES
Use HW more efficiently.
Context switching is the process of storing and restoring the execution state (context) of a process towards CPU.
so that execution can be resumed from the same point at a later time...
Each layer of abstraction involves multiple expensive user and kernel mode context switches
Even a simple network interaction between 2 applications results easily in 100s of context switches

GLOBAL PEER2PEER NETWORK
Structure :

●
●
●

●

Overlay network which lives on top of the existing internet or other peer2peer
networks created.
In a network, everyone is connected to everyone.
End-to-end encryption between users of an app and the app running
behind the network wall. Each user end network point = strongly
authenticated & uniquely identiﬁed independent of network carrier used.
No need for centralized ﬁrewall or vpn solutions, this is circle based
networking security.

Beneﬁts :
●
Finds shortest possible paths between peers
●
Full security through end-to-end encrypted
●
Allows for peer2peer links like meshed wireless
●
Can survive broken internet links and re-route when needed
●
Resolves the shortage of IPV4 addresses

PLANETARY NETWORK
TRADITIONAL
End-to-end encryption for all traffic across the network
Always look for shortest path, can route over multiple nodes
A permanent unique IP address linked to your private encryption key
Node is aware of its relative location to other nodes
IP address remains with the device even if moved
Topology extends gracefully across different mediums, i.e. mesh
Blockchain Based Bandwidth Usage Billing (farmers, users)
Ability to integrate with naming service on a blockchain
Can be used to connect IT workloads in ultra reliable, global and secure
way independent of physical network topology and medium.

Reliable: allow any 4 nodes to be unavailable
Data Privacy

Solution
-

Reliable: make 4 copies
Data Privacy: encrypt

Disadvantages

4 copies + original
400% overhead

-

400% overhead because of 4 copies
5x bandwidth required to store on multiple locations
Hacker only needs to have 1 copy = 1 location

How to visualize?
a+2b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j+k = 100
a-3b-c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j+k = 4
-a+b-4c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j+k = -8
… do this 20 times. Now remember these equations.
16 equations of the 20 allow you to calculate back the original.
Super Efﬁcient: only 20% overhead
= 20x less overhead compared to classic systems
Efﬁcient: Order of retrieval does not matter
Hacker proof: hacker needs to be on 16 locations
